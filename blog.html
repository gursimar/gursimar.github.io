    I<del>â€™m</del> was working as a senior research engineer at <a href="research.aspiringminds.com">Aspiring Minds Research labs</a>. Previously to this, I interned at the <a href="http://www.serc.iisc.in/facilities/">SuperComputer Education and Research Centre</a> (SERC, <a href="http://www.iisc.ac.in/">IISc</a>) and at the <a href="http://www.iitb.ac.in/">Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay</a> (IITB). I'm a recepient of the prestigious <a href="http://kvpy.iisc.ernet.in/main/index.htm">KVPY fellowship</a> (mentored), awarded by the Government of India to encourage talented students in research. I earned my Bachelors of Engineering (BE) in Computer Science from <a href="http://www.thapar.edu/">Thapar University</a>, Patiala in 2013.
    <br><br>
    <strong>Update</strong>: I will be joining <a href="">University of British Columbia</a> (UBC) as an MSc student in the computer science department in Fall, 2017.

<p style="text-align:justify;">
    Broadly, I'm interested in <b>machine learning</b> and <b>computer programming education</b>. I'm excited in applications of machine learning techniques to scale computer programming education and in assisstive technologies to help programmers become productive and write better code. Previously, at Aspiring Minds, I worked on automatic grading of computer programs, in terms of their functional correctness, stylistics, and runtime efficiency. Earlier I have been working on embedded systems and robotics and have a couple of popular national competitions.

<strong>ML-education</strong>: I, along with my colleagues at Aspiring Minds, contribute to bring machine learning practitioners under one roof with an aim to promote research and collaboration. As part of ML-India, we regularly interview industry and academic veterans on their research and journey into machine learning research. Also, we organize meetups where we organize hands-on, and featured talks on latest buzz in machine learning literature.
