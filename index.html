    I'm a graduate student in the Computer Science Department at the <a href="https://www.cs.ubc.ca/">University of British Columbia (UBC)</a>. I'm supervised by <a href="https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~little/">Jim Little</a> and is interested in applications of deep learning related to reasoning in multi-model data including videos, images and, text. Previous to this, as a research engineer at <a href="research.aspiringminds.com">Aspiring Minds Research labs</a>, India, I worked on automatic grading of computer programs, in terms of their functional correctness, stylistics, and runtime efficiency <a href="https://www.kdd.org/kdd2016/papers/files/adf0798-singhA.pdf">(link)</a>. I'm a recipient of the prestigious <a href="http://kvpy.iisc.ernet.in/main/index.htm">KVPY fellowship</a> (mentored), awarded by the Government of India to encourage talented students in research.

<strong>ML-India</strong>: While at Aspiring Minds, I, along with my colleagues, did various initiatives to promote research and collaboration among machine learning practitioners. As part of <a href="http://ml-india.org/">ML-India</a>, I interviewed industry and academic practitioners, started the ML-India Chandigarh chapter, organized meet-ups, hands-on and talks on the latest buzz in machine learning literature. Check out some of my work in ML-India [Links -> <a href="http://ml-india.org/ml-india-gurgaon-chapter-second-meetup/">1</a>, <a href="http://ml-india.org/ml-india-interview-priya-radhakrishnan/">2</a>, <a href="http://ml-india.org/ml-india-interview-avisek-lahiri/">3</a>, <a href="http://ml-india.org/ml-india-interview-niraj-kumar/">4</a>, ...].

<strong>Community and opensource</strong>: I'm have been an active member of various undergraduate computing societies and open source communities. I have served as the Joint Secretary of the computing society at Thapar University, Patiala. Check out my work in Ubuntu [<a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/simar/MembershipApplication">link</a>] and Creative Computing Society (CCS) [<a href="https://github.com/gursimar/creativeComputingSociety">link</a>]. Also, I put up the webpage of my research group at University of the British Columbia [<a href="https://vision.cs.ubc.ca">link</a>]
