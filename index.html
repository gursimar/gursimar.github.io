    I'm a CS graduate student at the <a href="https://www.cs.ubc.ca/">University of British Columbia (UBC)</a>. My supervisor is <a href="https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~little/">Jim Little</a> and I'm interested in deep learning, video understanding, and reinforcement learning. Previously, I worked as a research engineer at <a href="https://research.aspiringminds.com">Aspiring Minds Research Labs</a>, India. I worked on automatic grading of computer programs, in terms of their functional correctness, stylistics, and runtime efficiency <a href="https://www.kdd.org/kdd2016/papers/files/adf0798-singhA.pdf">(link)</a>. Also, I'm a recipient of the prestigious <a href="http://kvpy.iisc.ernet.in/main/index.htm">KVPY fellowship</a> (mentored), awarded by the Government of India to encourage talented students in research.

<strong>ML-India</strong>: ML-India is an initiative to promote research and collaboration among machine learning practitioners in India. As part of <a href="http://ml-india.org/">ML-India</a>, I interviewed both industry and academic ML practitioners [Links - <a href="http://ml-india.org/ml-india-interview-priya-radhakrishnan/">1</a>, <a href="http://ml-india.org/ml-india-interview-avisek-lahiri/">2</a>, <a href="http://ml-india.org/ml-india-interview-niraj-kumar/">3</a>], started the ML-India Chandigarh chapter, and organized meet-ups [Links -> <a href="http://ml-india.org/ml-india-gurgaon-chapter-second-meetup/">1</a>, <a href="http://ml-india.org/ml-india-gurgaon-chapter-tenth-meetup/">2</a>, <a href="http://ml-india.org/ml-india-gurgaon-chapter-ninth-meetup/">3</a>]. I was also part of the team which took the first initiative to teach data science to kids [<a href="http://www.datasciencekids.org/p/home-page.html">link</a>].

<strong>Community and opensource</strong>: During my undergraduate, I was an active member of the University's computing society (CCS) and served as Joint Secretary [<a href="https://github.com/gursimar/creativeComputingSociety">link</a>]. Also, I was active in the Ubuntu open source community where I maintained a package and served as a member of the Bug Triage team [<a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/simar/MembershipApplication">link</a>]. At UBC, I helped set up and maintain the webpage of the computer vision lab. [<a href="https://vision.cs.ubc.ca">link</a>]
